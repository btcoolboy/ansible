### resources

This role allows management of custom file paths, file contents and
archives on remote hosts without the need to create a separate Ansible
role. You can use inventory lists to define what files to copy, what
directories should exist on a remote host, what online resources to
download, and so on.

Read the [resources role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/resources/) for more details.
