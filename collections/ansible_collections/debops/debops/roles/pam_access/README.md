### pam_access

The [Linux Pluggable Authentication
Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) provide dynamic
authentication support to services on Linux hosts. The
`debops.pam_access` role can be used to manage one aspect of PAM -
access control rules that can be used to grant or revoke access to
services based on users, groups and origins.

Read the [pam_access role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/pam_access/) for more details.
