### salt

The `debops.salt` Ansible role can be used to install and configure
[SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/) Master service. It is expected that
Salt Minions are installed using host deployment methods like
PXE/preseeding, LXC template scripts, etc. and contact the Salt Master
service over DNS.

Read the [salt role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/salt/) for more details.
