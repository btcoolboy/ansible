### ferm

[ferm](http://ferm.foo-projects.org/) is a wrapper around the `iptables`
and the `ip6tables` commands which lets you manage host firewalls in an
easy and Ansible-friendly way. This role can be used to setup firewall
rules directly from the inventory, or it can be used as a dependency by
other roles to setup firewall rules for other services.

Read the [ferm role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/ferm/) for more details.
