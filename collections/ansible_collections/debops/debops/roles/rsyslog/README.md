### rsyslog

The [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/) package is used to read,
process, store and forward system logs in different ways, on local or
remote systems. The `debops.rsyslog` role can be used to easily
configure log forwarding to a central log server, as well as store logs
on the filesystem or other storage backends.

Read the [rsyslog role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/rsyslog/) for more details.
