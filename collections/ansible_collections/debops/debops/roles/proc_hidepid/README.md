### proc_hidepid

This role will ensure that the `/proc` filesystem is mounted with the
`hidepid=` option enabled. [The 'hidepid='
option](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#hidepid) can be
used to hide processes that don't belong to a particular user account.

Read the [proc_hidepid role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/proc_hidepid/) for more details.
