### debops_legacy

The `debops.debops_legacy` Ansible role can be used to clean up legacy
files, directories, APT packages or `dpkg-divert` diversions created by
DebOps but no longer used.

The role is not included in the main DebOps playbook to not cause data
destruction by mistake. You are advised to use it with caution - it will
destroy data on your DebOps hosts. To check the changes that will be
done before implementing them, you can run the role against DebOps hosts
with:

    debops run service/debops_legacy -l <host> --diff --check

Any changes that the role will create on the hosts can be overridden via
the Ansible inventory if needed.

Read the [debops_legacy role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/debops_legacy/) for more details.
