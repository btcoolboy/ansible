### machine

The `debops.machine` Ansible role manages basic information about a
given host located in the `/etc/machine-info` configuration file, as
well as static and dynamic Message Of The Day (MOTD) shown after login,
and the contents of the `/etc/issue` file displayed on the [system
console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console).

Read the [machine role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/machine/) for more details.
