### pki

The `debops.pki` role provides a standardized management of the X.509
certificates on hosts controlled by Ansible. Other Ansible roles can
utilize the environment created by `debops.pki` to automatically enable
TLS/SSL encrypted connections.

Using this role, you can bootstrap a Public Key Infrastructure in your
environment using an internal Certificate Authority, easily switch the
active set of certificates between internal and external Certificate
Authorities, or use the ACME protocol to automatically obtain
certificates from CA that support it (for example [Let's
Encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt)).

Read the [pki role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/pki/) for more details.
