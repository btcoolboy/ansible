### tcpwrappers

The `debops.tcpwrappers` Ansible role can be used to manage entries in
`/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` which are used by TCP Wrappers
to limit connections to daemons that utilize the `libwrap` library.

Read the [tcpwrappers role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/tcpwrappers/) for more details.
