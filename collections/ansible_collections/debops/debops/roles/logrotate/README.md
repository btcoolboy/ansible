### logrotate

The `logrotate` package is used to periodically rotate logs, so that
they don't fill up the disk space on the filesystem. Rotated logs can be
moved to a different host or emailed before removal for archival
purposes.

The `debops.logrotate` Ansible role allows you to manage log rotation
configuration for system packages, or create custom log configuration.
The role can be used by other roles as a dependency to make automatic
`logrotate` configuration easier.

Read the [logrotate role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/logrotate/) for more details.
