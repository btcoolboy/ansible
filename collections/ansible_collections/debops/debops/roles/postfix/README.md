### postfix

The `debops.postfix` Ansible role can be used to install and manage
[Postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_%28software%29), a SMTP
server. It allows configuration of Postfix using Ansible inventory
variables, and provides a flexible API to the Postfix configuration for
other Ansible roles when it's used as a role dependency.

Read the [postfix role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/postfix/) for more details.
