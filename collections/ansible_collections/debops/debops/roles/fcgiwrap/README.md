### fcgiwrap

[fcgiwrap](https://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap) is a lightweight FastCGI
server which can be set up behind `nginx` server to run CGI
applications. This role allows you to setup separate instances of
`fcgiwrap` on different user accounts, each one accessible through its
own UNIX socket.

Read the [fcgiwrap role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/fcgiwrap/) for more details.
