### redis_server

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an in-memory key/value store, usable as a
persistent database, cache or a message broker.

The `debops.redis_server` Ansible role can be used to install and manage
Redis on Debian/Ubuntu hosts. Role supports management of multiple Redis
instances on a single host and is designed to cope with modifications
done to Redis configuration files at runtime.

Read the [redis_server role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/redis_server/) for more details.
