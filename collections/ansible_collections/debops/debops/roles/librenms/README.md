### librenms

[LibreNMS](http://www.librenms.org/) is a network monitoring dashboard
written in PHP. It can use SNMP, `collectd`, `check_mk` or other agents
to gather data from variety of devices (switches, routers, servers,
etc.) and graph them using RRD. It's easy to use, and can perform
autodiscovery to find and monitor additional devices.

`debops.librenms` role will manage a central LibreNMS monitoring host
and web interface.

Read the [librenms role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/librenms/) for more details.
