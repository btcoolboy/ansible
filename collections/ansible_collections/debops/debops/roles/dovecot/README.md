### dovecot

The `dovecot` daemon, maintained by the [Dovecot
Project](https://www.dovecot.org/), is a modern IMAP and POP3 email
server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in
mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large
installations. Itâ€™s fast, simple to set up, requires no special
administration and it uses very little memory.

The `debops.dovecot` Ansible role can be used to configure the `dovecot`
service on a host and to automatically setup various auxiliary roles,
such as `debops.pki` for SSL/TLS encryption.

Read the [dovecot role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/dovecot/) for more details.
