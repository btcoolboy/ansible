### gitlab

The `debops.gitlab` role can be used to install and manage a GitLab
instance. It supports automatic update of the currently installed
version (when the role is executed), as well as upgrade to a next stable
GitLab release. You can deploy the installation either on a single host,
or a set of separate hosts, each one with a different service (database,
application, webserver).

Read the [gitlab role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/gitlab/) for more details.
