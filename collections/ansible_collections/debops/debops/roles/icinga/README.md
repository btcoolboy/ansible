### icinga

The [Icinga](https://www.icinga.com/) project is a monitoring solution
which can be used to monitor infrastructure hosts and services. Icinga
can use variety of remote agents as well as SNMP to monitor remote
hosts.

DebOps provides support for Icinga 2, split into several roles:

-   the `debops.icinga` role is the Icinga 2 Agent role, usually
    installed on all hosts in the cluster that should be monitored.
    Different instances can function as masters, satellites or clients
    depending on the configuration.
-   the `debops.icinga_db` role can be used to configure the database
    support for Icinga 2, used by the web interface. Both PostgreSQL and
    MariaDB databases are supported.
-   the `debops.icinga_web` role manages the Icinga 2 Web interface,
    including installation of external modules like Icinga 2 Director.

Read the [icinga role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/icinga/) for more details.
