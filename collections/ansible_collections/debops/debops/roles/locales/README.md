### locales

The `debops.locales` Ansible role manages localization and
internationalization configuration, used by the `locales` Debian
package. The role can be used as a dependency of other Ansible roles to
ensure that the localization is properly configured on the host.

Read the [locales role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/locales/) for more details.
