### unbound

[Unbound](https://unbound.net/) is a local DNS resolver. It supports
[DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC) validation and can be
used to ensure that DNS queries protected by DNSSEC are signed by the
correct DNS root zone key, verified locally.

Read the [unbound role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/unbound/) for more details.
