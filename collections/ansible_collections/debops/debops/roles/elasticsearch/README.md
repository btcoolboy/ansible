### elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch) is a
distributed search engine and storage system, also a part of the Elastic
Stack. The software is developed by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/).

The `debops.elasticsearch` Ansible role can be used to deploy and manage
Elasticsearch instances on one or more (3+) hosts. The role can be used
as a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow control over their
configuration options in the Elasticsearch configuration file.

Read the [elasticsearch role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/elasticsearch/) for more details.
