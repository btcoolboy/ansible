### debops_fact

The `debops.debops_fact` Ansible role can be used to read JSON data from
a set of INI configuration files and make them available as Ansible
local facts. This mechanism can be used to maintain common facts between
separate Ansible roles without the need for them to know about the
specific file structures, using `ini_file` Ansible module.

Read the [debops_fact role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/debops_fact/) for more details.
