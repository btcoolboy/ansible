### sshd

[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is a secure replacement for `telnet`
and other remote control programs. It allows you to connect to remote
hosts over a encrypted communication channel and to perform a variety of
tasks. It's also the primary communication channel used by Ansible.

Read the [sshd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/sshd/) for more details.
