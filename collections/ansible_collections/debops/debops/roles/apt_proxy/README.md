### apt_proxy

This role manages the HTTP/HTTPS/FTP proxy configuration for APT. You
can define what proxy to use, what hosts should be connected to
directly, as well as set additional APT configuration options related to
proxies as needed.

The role also features proxy online detection support to silently
skip/ignore temporally offline proxies which can make sense for
workstations and home servers.

Read the [apt_proxy role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/apt_proxy/) for more details.
