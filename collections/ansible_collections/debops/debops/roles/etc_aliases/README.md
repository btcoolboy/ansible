### etc_aliases

The `/etc/aliases` file contains the mail alias database used by the
various SMTP daemons to redirect local mail to remote recipients, local
files, commands, etc. See the `aliases(5)` for more details.

This role can be used to set the contents of the alias database, either
using Ansible inventory variables, or as a dependency of another Ansible
role.

Read the [etc_aliases role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/etc_aliases/) for more details.
