### influxdb_server

[InfluxDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfluxDB) is an open-source
time series database (TSDB) developed by InfluxData. It is written in Go
and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time
series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application
metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.
Ansible roles `debops.influxdb` and `debops.influxdb_server` allow you
to manage a InfluxDB server and / or access it remotely from other
hosts.

The `debops.influxdb_server` role is the "server" part - it installs
`influxdb` Debian package, and configures access to the database from
`root` admin account. After that, you can use `debops.influxdb` role to
manage databases and user accounts on the server.

Read the [influxdb_server role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/influxdb_server/) for more details.
