### slapd

[OpenLDAP](https://openldap.org/) is an open source [Lightweight
DIrectory Access
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
server, that can be used for centralized directory services.

The `debops.slapd` Ansible role can be used to install and manage
OpenLDAP server (`slapd`) on Debian or Ubuntu hosts. The role supports
easy management of the on-line configuration (OLC) used to manage
`slapd` instances and integrates with other DebOps roles like
`debops.pki` and `debops.dhparam` for additional functionality.

Read the [slapd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/slapd/) for more details.
