### netbase

The `debops.netbase` Ansible role manages the hostname stored in
`/etc/hostname`, as well as the local host and network database located
in `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/networks` files, respectively. It can be used
as a substitute for a DNS service for small number of hosts; with bigger
network or larger clusters usage of a real DNS server is preferred.

Read the [netbase role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/netbase/) for more details.
