### iscsi

[Open-iSCSI](http://open-iscsi.org/) is a Linux iSCSI Initiator which
can be used to connect to iSCSI Targets to access block storage devices
remotely as if they were connected locally.

`debops.iscsi` Ansible role allows you to configure the initiator,
targets, as well as create LVM Volume Groups from presented iSCSI LUNs
and manage LVM Logical Volumes.

Read the [iscsi role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/iscsi/) for more details.
