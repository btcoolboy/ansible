### apt_install

The `debops.apt_install` Ansible role is meant to be used as an easy way
to install APT packages on hosts that don't require more extensive
configuration which would require a more extensive, custom Ansible role.
The role itself exposes several Ansible default variables which can be
used to specify custom lists of packages on different levels of Ansible
inventory (global, per-group or per-host).

Read the [apt_install role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/apt_install/) for more details.
