### dhcpd

The `debops.dhcpd` role can be used to configure [ISC DHCP
Server](https://www.isc.org/dhcp/), either standalone or in a two-host
failover configuration. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
configuration, but note that DHCPv6 failover is not supported in ISC
DHCP Server.

Read the [dhcpd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/dhcpd/) for more details.
