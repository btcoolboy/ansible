### tftpd

This Ansible role can configure a standalone TFTP server using the
`tftpd-hpa` daemon. The TFTP server can be used to serve files for
embedded devices or serve iPXE files from `debops.ipxe` role to other
hosts on the network, allowing for network boot and OS installation.

Read the [tftpd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/tftpd/) for more details.
