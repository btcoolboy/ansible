### php

The `debops.php` role can be used to manage PHP Hypertext Preprocessor
environment on a Debian/Ubuntu host. The role supports different PHP
versions available in OS distributions (PHP5, PHP7) with PHP-FPM service
and multiple PHP-FPM pools. Other Ansible roles can use it as a role
dependency to offload PHP management for their own use.

Read the [php role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/php/) for more details.
