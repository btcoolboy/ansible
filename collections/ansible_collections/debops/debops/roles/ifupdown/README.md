### ifupdown

`ifupdown` is a set of high-level scripts in Debian/Ubuntu Linux
distributions which can be used to configure network interfaces,
bridges, VLAN interfaces, bonding, and so on. You can find example
configuration and usage guides on the
[NetworkConfiguration](https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration)
page of the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/).

`debops.ifupdown` is an Ansible role which wraps `ifupdown` in an easy
to use, and Ansible-friendly interface. It aims to be a safe and
reliable way to let you configure network interfaces on hosts managed
using Ansible. It can be used either as a standalone role configured
using role/inventory variables, or as a dependency of another role, to
provide network configuration as needed.

Read the [ifupdown role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/ifupdown/) for more details.
