### memcached

[memcached](https://memcached.org/) is a cache daemon which keeps its
data in RAM. It can be used by other applications to speed up slow
operations on the databases/data stores.

Read the [memcached role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/memcached/) for more details.
