### monit

[Monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) is a service monitoring daemon. It
can be used to monitor processes, files, system and remote hosts, and if
necessary, take configured actions when specific parameters change, like
restarting services and notifying the system administrator.

This role can be used to configure Monit on a host. It will
automatically detect selected services and configure checks for them.

Read the [monit role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/monit/) for more details.
