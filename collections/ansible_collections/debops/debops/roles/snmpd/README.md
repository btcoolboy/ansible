### snmpd

[SNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol)
is an universal protocol which can be used to monitor and manage
networked devices. `debops.snmpd` role can be used to configure `snmpd`
service on a Debian or Ubuntu host, which in turn can be used to monitor
that host resources like CPU utilization, memory and storage capacity,
network usage and more.

Read the [snmpd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/snmpd/) for more details.
