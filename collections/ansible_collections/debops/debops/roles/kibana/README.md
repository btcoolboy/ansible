### kibana

[Kibana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibana) is a web interface which
can be used to display and analyze data stored in an Elasticsearch
cluster. It is a part of the Elastic Stack. The software is developed by
[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/).

The `debops.kibana` Ansible role can be used to deploy Kibana behind an
`nginx` reverse proxy which connects to a local or remote Elasticsearch
cluster. The role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible roles to
allow control over their configuration options in the Kibana
configuration file.

Read the [kibana role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/kibana/) for more details.
