### stunnel

[stunnel](https://stunnel.org/) can be used to create encrypted TCP
tunnels between two service ports, either on the same host or on
separate hosts.

Encryption is done using SSL certificates. This Ansible role can be used
to create tunnels between two or more hosts, using Ansible inventory
groups.

Read the [stunnel role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/stunnel/) for more details.
