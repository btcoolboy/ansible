### libvirt

The `debops.libvirt` role can be used to manage networks and storage
pools defined in [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) virtualization service.
It's designed to be used either "locally", directly on a given host, or
"remotely" from a central host through the API.

To configure a host to provide the `libvirtd` service you can use the
`debops.libvirtd` role.

Read the [libvirt role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/libvirt/) for more details.
