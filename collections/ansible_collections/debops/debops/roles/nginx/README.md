### nginx

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) is a fast and light webserver with
extensible configuration.

The `debops.nginx` role can be used to install and manage <span
class="title-ref">nginx</span> configuration for multiple websites at
the same time. The server is configured using inventory variables. This
role can also be used as a dependency of another role to configure a
webserver for that role using dependency variables.

Read the [nginx role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/nginx/) for more details.
