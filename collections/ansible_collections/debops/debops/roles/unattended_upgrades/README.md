### unattended_upgrades

The `unattended-upgrades` package manages [automatic, unattended
upgrades](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades) of the
Debian-based hosts. You can specify what package origins are included in
the unattended upgrades, as well as specify what packages should be
exempt from the upgrades, among other things.

Read the [unattended_upgrades role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/unattended_upgrades/) for more details.
