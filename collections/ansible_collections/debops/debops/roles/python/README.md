### python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a popular, dynamic programming
language available on GNU/Linux platforms. Ansible is written in Python
and requires Python on remote host for normal operations.

The `debops.python` Ansible role can be used to manage the Python
environment on a Debian/Ubuntu host. Role supports multiple Python
versions installed on a host at the same time, which is the default
practice in Debian.

A special "raw" mode of operation with a separate Ansible playbook can
be used to bootstrap Python environment on a host, so that Ansible can
then install packages and operate normally.

Read the [python role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/python/) for more details.
