### atd

The `at` and `batch` commands can be used to compliment `cron` and run
one-off tasks either at a specified time, or when the host CPU
utilization is on a low enough level.

The `debops.atd` role can be used to configure the `atd` service,
including randomized load average threshold and randomized time between
batch job execution, as well as access control to the `at` and `batch`
commands by the users.

Read the [atd role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/atd/) for more details.
