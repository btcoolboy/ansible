### sysnews

This role can be used to manage "System News" bulletin displayed after
users log in to a particular host using local system console or SSH.
System News can be used to notify users about important changes on the
host; this is especially useful in multi-user environments or on bastion
hosts.

The System News can be read by executing the `news` command in the
shell. You can read all of the news entries by executing the `news -a`
command.

Read the [sysnews role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/sysnews/) for more details.
