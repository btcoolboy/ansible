### resolvconf

The `/etc/resolv.conf` configuration file defines the system-wide DNS
resolver configuration. It is a central location to configure the DNS
nameservers, search domains and other options. In modern Linux systems,
many services might want to change that configuration file to enable
their functionality -
[NetworkManager](https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager), `ifupdown`,
[dnsmasq](https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq), `unbound` being
several examples of that.

To avoid clashes between various software packages modifying the
`/etc/resolv.conf` file, the `resolvconf` package provides a stable API
to the `/etc/resolv.conf` that combines information from other services
and creates a consistent resolver configuration.

The `debops.resolvconf` Ansible role further updates the `resolvconf`
configuration to fix issues with outdated defaults on modern
Debian/Ubuntu hosts. By default the role will update the interface order
list to include the [Predictable Network Interface
Names](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/)
as well as clarify the order of the NetworkManager interfaces. The role
will also automatically rearrange the configuration of VPN tunnels if a
local DNS resolver is detected.

Contrary to its name, the `debops.resolvconf` role does not configure
the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly. You should consult the
documentation of various DNS-related services to see how you can modify
the contents of this file through them.

Read the [resolvconf role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/resolvconf/) for more details.
