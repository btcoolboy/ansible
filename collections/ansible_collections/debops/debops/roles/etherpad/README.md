### etherpad

[Etherpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etherpad) is a collaborative
text editor usable through a web browser. Documents can be edited by
multiple people in real time, shared and exported in different formats.

This role can be used to deploy and configure [Etherpad
Lite](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite), a NodeJS version of
Etherpad, on a Debian/Ubuntu host. The application can use a MariaDB or
SQLite database as a storage backend, and will be configured behind a
Nginx proxy as a frontend.

Read the [etherpad role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/etherpad/) for more details.
