### backup2l

The `debops.backup2l` role manages the
[backup2l](https://github.com/gkiefer/backup2l) (backup tool) script.
This script can be used to make automated, incremental archives of a
given host which can be copied to another system as a backup.

Read the [backup2l role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/backup2l/) for more details.
