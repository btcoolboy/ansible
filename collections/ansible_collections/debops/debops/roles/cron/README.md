### cron

The `debops.cron` Ansible role can be used to manage `cron` jobs through
Ansible inventory. You can define `cron` jobs at different levels of
Ansible inventory (all hosts, a group of hosts, specific hosts) and
manage custom files or scripts required by the jobs.

Read the [cron role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-3.0/ansible/roles/cron/) for more details.
