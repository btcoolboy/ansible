### lvm

[Logical Volume
Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux))
lets you manage your disk space in a more elastic way, separating
physical hard disks from the logical volumes.

This Ansible role lets you configure `/etc/lvm/lvm.conf` configuration
file, as well as gives you a set of variables which can be used to
manage LVM logical volumes, automatically create filesystems on them and
mount them as needed.

Read the [lvm role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/HEAD/ansible/roles/lvm/) for more details.
